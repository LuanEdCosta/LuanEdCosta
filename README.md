## :page_with_curl: About me

Hi, my name is Luan Eduardo da Costa, I'm a web and mobile developer that loves JavaScript and it's ecosystem. I'm always searching for new things to do and learning new concepts and technologies.

I'm currently working at [Unicode Software](https://www.unicodesoftware.com.br/) creating Android, iOS and Web apps with React and React Native, some of them to integrate with the main product of the company and also new projects.
